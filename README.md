# computer-configs

This is blatant plagiarism of Vince Buffalo's [dotfile repository](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/dotfiles) to create a bunch of config files and scripts that are can be run automatically to install and configure my commonly used software.

## Included things:

- R packages
- tmux
- Sublime Text


## Mac vs. Linux

I have split the actually install scripts into Mac and Linux, although some files are shared across both.
